# Hi, I'm Omolabake

I am an aspiring Data Analyst currently developing my skills in data analysis, visualization, and database querying. This repository serves as a portfolio of the projects I complete as I continue learning and growing in the field.

## Project Highlights

- **[Performance Dashboard](https://github.com/adesonaomolabake09-svg/performance-dashboard)**  
  Tracks key performance metrics. While creating it, I learned how to structure data for meaningful insights, choose the right visualizations, and use Excel/Power BI effectively.

- **[Sales Dashboard](https://github.com/adesonaomolabake09-svg/sales-dashboard)**  
  An interactive dashboard showcasing sales trends and product performance. Building it improved my ability to clean and organize data, analyze trends, and design dashboards that communicate insights clearly.
