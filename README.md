## Project Highlights

Here are some of my dashboard projects so far:

- **[Performance Dashboard](https://github.com/OmolabakeAdesona/performance-dashboard)**  
  Tracks key performance metrics. While creating it, I learned how to structure data for meaningful insights, choose the right visualizations, and use Excel/Power BI effectively.

- **[Sales Dashboard](https://github.com/OmolabakeAdesona/sales-dashboard)**  
  An interactive dashboard showcasing sales trends and product performance. Building it improved my ability to clean and organize data, analyze trends, and design dashboards that communicate insights clearly.
